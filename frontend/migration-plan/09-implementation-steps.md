- [ ] Connect form submissions to server actions
- [ ] Test core feature functionality

## Phase 5: Testing and Deployment (Week 5)

### Day 1-3: Testing
- [ ] Configure Playwright for Next.js
- [ ] Update existing tests for new structure
- [ ] Add tests for Next.js specific features
- [ ] Run and debug test suite

### Day 4-5: Deployment
- [ ] Create production Docker configuration
- [ ] Set up build pipeline
- [ ] Configure deployment environment
- [ ] Test in staging environment

## Incremental Migration Approach

To minimize disruption, consider a gradual migration approach:

1. Create the Next.js project alongside existing code
2. Migrate one feature at a time
3. Set up route redirects to handle both old and new routes
4. Test each component thoroughly after migration
5. Deploy in phases, using feature flags if necessary
6. Once fully migrated, remove the old codebase
