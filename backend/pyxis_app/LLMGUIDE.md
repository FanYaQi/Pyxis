# Collaboration guide.

Always state clearly these and ask for my opinion before coding:

1. What is going to be implmented. Purpose and functionality.
2. The file locations.

# Coding guide.

1. Do not duplicate enum definitions, define it once and use it everywhere.
2. Do not expose all models in __init__.py file in models/ folder to avoid possible circular dependencies.
